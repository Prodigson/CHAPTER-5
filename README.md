Understanding the Widget Tree

In this chapter, "Understanding the Widget Tree" I learned that the widget tree is the result of nested widgets. As the number of widgets increases, the widget tree expands quickly and lessens code readability and manageability. I call this the full widget tree. To improve code readability and manageability, you can separate widgets into their own widget class, creating a shallower widget tree. In each app, you should strive to keep the widget tree shallow. By refactoring with a widget class, you can take advantage of Flutterâ€™s subtree rebuilding, which improves performance. I learned about the available widgets for Material Design and Cupertino and how to nest widgets to compose the UI layout. The basic widgets covered for Material Design were Scaffold, AppBar, CircleAvatar, Divider, SingleChildScrollView, Padding, Column, Row, Container, Expanded, Text, Stack, and Positioned. The basic widgets covered for Cupertino were CupertinoPageScaffold, CupertinoTabScaffold, and CupertinoNavigationBar.
